load.sh is used to load dicom zip files from GCS into Orthanc, e.g.:
	>> # Onetime installation of dependencies for loading data
	>>./config_loader.sh

	>> # Get list of zips to load
	>>./getzips.sh UCEC > foo
	>>./load.sh foo 

The completed zips are written to the file ./done. load.sh searches done for a zip,
and skips loading it if found.
